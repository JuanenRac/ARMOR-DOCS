**Honesty check - what runs today:** This repository documents interfaces and procedures that have been validated, and it says plainly what has not. Read the [capability matrix](docs/CAPABILITY_MATRIX.md) before believing any feature is "done": it says for each one whether it was only simulated, tested on a computer or verified on real hardware.

## 🎯 Overview

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/ARMOR_FAMILY.svg" alt="A.R.M.O.R. family" width="100%">
</p>

* [Capability matrix](docs/CAPABILITY_MATRIX.md): for each capability, is it simulated, local or verified on hardware?
* [Architecture](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md): networks, trust boundaries, time and ordering.
* [Security baseline](docs/SECURITY_BASELINE.md): the VLAN design, what the code enforces and what is still missing.
* [Project catalogue](docs/PROJECT_CATALOG.md): the twelve repositories, their versions and how they depend on each other.
* [Interfaces](docs/INTERFACES.md): who produces and consumes each interface and where it is trusted.
* [First vertical slice](docs/FIRST_VERTICAL_SLICE.md): what the simulator-to-console test proves and what it does not.
* **Tools:** `make_readmes.py` writes the README of every repository in the seven languages, `make_brand.py` its banner and icon, `publication_check.py` looks for anything private before a publication and `clean_history.py` makes a publishable copy of a repository.

## 📂 Repository Structure

```text
ARMOR-DOCS/
├── docs/     CAPABILITY_MATRIX, ARCHITECTURE, SECURITY_BASELINE, PROJECT_CATALOG, INTERFACES, FIRST_VERTICAL_SLICE
├── tools/    make_readmes.py (+ readme_data/), make_brand.py, publication_check.py, clean_history.py, check_all.sh
├── brand/    the emblem
└── images/   this repository's banner and icon
```

## 🛠️ Development Environment

```bash
python tools/make_readmes.py --check      # the READMEs (7 languages) are current
python tools/make_brand.py --check        # the banners and icons are current
python tools/publication_check.py         # nothing private would leave with a publication
bash tools/check_all.sh                   # every repository's own tests, in one run
```

The audits of the family (in Spanish) are kept in this repository's root.
